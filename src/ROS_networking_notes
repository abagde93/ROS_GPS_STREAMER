Once ROS is installed on a system:

1. Navigate to catkin_ws, or whatever the development folder is called
2. source devel/setup.bash --> or go to ros tutorials to add to startup, so that   you don't have do do this every time a new window is opened
3. Now test that ROS is running by typing "roscore" or "rosnode list"

Once ROS is up and running on several systems:

1. Make sure these systems are on the same network. Edit /etc/hosts file
2. Make sure each system has all other systems username and ip address
3. Make sure machines can ping each other(from names, not IP's
4. Start roscore on "master" machine
5. run: export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<master_name>:11311
6. If everything has gone well you should see the same rostopic list on every ma   chine
